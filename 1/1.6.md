Using `new-if` causes an infinite loop but not exactly sure why.

From the footnotes: A minor difference between if and cond is that the `<e>` part
of each cond clause may be a sequence of expressions. If the corresponding `<p>`
is found to be true, the expressions <e> *are evaluated in sequence and the value
of the final expression in the sequence is returned as the value of the cond*. In
an if expression, however, the `<consequent>` and `<alternative>` must be single
expressions.

My guess is that the "evaluated in sequence" and "final expression is returned"
has something to do with the loop. But it's not clear to me if "evaluated in
sequence" refers to recursion.

## Update

Once I more fully understood exercise 1.5 this was easy to grok.

```
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
          (else else-clause)))

(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                     x)))
```

Applicative order - "evaluate the arguments and then apply". The `new-if`
arguments can be broken down as follows:

predicate => good-enough?
then-clause => guess
else-clause => sqrt-iter (called recursively)

The `else-clause` will be evaluate over and over again, thus we get stuck in a loop.
