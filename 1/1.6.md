Using `new-if` causes an infinite loop but not exactly sure why.

From the footnotes: A minor difference between if and cond is that the `<e>` part
of each cond clause may be a sequence of expressions. If the corresponding `<p>`
is found to be true, the expressions <e> *are evaluated in sequence and the value
of the final expression in the sequence is returned as the value of the cond*. In
an if expression, however, the `<consequent>` and `<alternative>` must be single
expressions.

My guess is that the "evaluated in sequence" and "final expression is returned"
has something to do with the loop. But it's not clear to me if "evaluated in
sequence" refers to recursion.
