```
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))

(test 0 (p))
```

I wasn't sure what `(define (p) (p))` would do so I tried it in a repl.
Called `p` and nothing happened, then I tried `(p)` and it hung in a loop.

Applicative-order evaluation will evaluate the predicate and return 0. Something
like this:

```
  (if (= 0 0)
      0
      (p))
```

The `if` is evaluated, returns 0 and stops.

(My guess) Normal-order evaluation will try to expand everything in-place and cause
something like an infinite loop because `(p)` will call `(p)` will call `(p)`...
(maybe a stack overflow? hehe).

## Update 1

I got it backwards. Applicative-order will cause an infinite loop. Should have
been obvious to me when I ran it in the repl and "it hung in a loop". derp

## Update 2

I was misunderstanding this exercise. In applicative-order we "evaluate the
arguments and then apply". I was doing the evaluation at the wrong place/level.

Using a different example: `(sum-of-squares (+ a 1) (* a 2))`

When I incorrectly understood things I was trying to do "sum-of-squares" before
evaluating `(+ a 1)` and `(* a 2)`. But in applicative-order we need to evaluate
the arguments `(+ a 1)` and `(* a 2)` first.

So back to this exercise,

```
(test 0 (p))

becomes

(if (= 0 0)
    0
    (p))
```

We need to evaluate the "then" and "else" clause before evaluating the predicate
and that is what gets us stuck in a loop - the "else" clause repeatedly calling
`(p)`
