(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))

(test 0 (p))

# First Answer

I wasn't sure what `(define (p) (p))` would do so I tried it in a repl.
Called `p` and nothing happened, then I tried `(p)` and it hung in a loop.

Applicative-order evaluation will evaluate the predicate and return 0. Something
like this:

```
  (if (= 0 0)
      0
      (p))
```

The `if` is evaluated, returns 0 and stops.

(My guess) Normal-order evaluation will try to expand everything in-place and cause
something like an infinite loop because `(p)` will call `(p)` will call `(p)`...
(maybe a stack overflow? hehe).

# Second Answer

I got it backwards. Applicative-order will cause an infinite loop. Should have
been obvious to me when I ran it in the repl and "it hung in a loop". derp
