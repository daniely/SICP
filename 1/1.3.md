Initially had trouble because I didn't realize I should be
looking for the minimum and taking the other two values. The thought did occur to
me early on but I didn't explore it and instead went down other incorrect paths.

Another early mistake was thinking I explicitly needed the largest and
second largest numbers. Trying to write code to find them one at a time
further confused me and led me down the wrong path.

A bad habit I have in general is trying to figure things out too procedurally
and it came into play here. I believe it led me to thinking I needed to check
every single value against each other. So instead of just `a > b < c` I was
doing stuff like this:

```
# one of several conditions for finding the 2 largest numbers
if a < b > c
  if a > c
    a b
  else
    b c
  end
end
```

The one correct hunch I had was realizing that finding the 2 largest numbers
would be the hard part of solving this.

In hindsight, it should have been obvious to me that what I wanted was
a list and that finding the minimum would be an easy way to do this.
LISP stands for **LIS**t **P**rocessing after all.

```
(define (foo a b c)
  (cond ((and (< b a) (< b c)) (+ (* a a) (* c c)))
        ((and (< c a) (< c b)) (+ (* a a) (* b b)))
        ((and (< a b) (< a c)) (+ (* b b) (* c c))))
)
```
