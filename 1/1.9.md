## Update

I got the details wrong here. Yes, they are both recursive but the first is
`linear recursive` while the second is `linear iterative`. You can tell which
it will be by looking at the arguments. If the argument must be evaluated
recursively (deferred operations) then it will be `linear recursive`, otherwise
`linear iterative`. Another hint is if "the program variables provide a
complete description of the state of the process at any point" then it is
`linear iterative`.

Here's how the second problem expands out:

```
  (+ 4 5)
  (+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
  (+ (3) (6))
  (+ (dec 3) (inc 6))
  (+ (2) (7))
  (+ (dec 2) (inc 7))
  (+ (1) (8))
  (+ (dec 1) (inc 8))
  (+ (0) (9))
```

## Original Answer

First time trying this problem I got stuck. After a few days I came back to
it and decided to manually subsitute the fibonacci sequence. Doing
so helped unblock me and enabled me to finish the problem.

```
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
```

```
(+ 4 5)

# dec four times to get 4 to 0
(inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
(inc (inc (+ (dec (dec 4)) 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ (dec (dec (dec 4))) 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec (dec (dec (dec 4)))) 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec (dec (dec 3))) 5))))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec (dec 2)) 5))))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1)) 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9
```

```
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

```
(+ 4 5)

# dec four times to get 4 to 0
(+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
(+ (dec (dec 4)) (inc (inc 5)))
(+ (dec (dec (dec 4))) (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(+ (dec (dec (dec (dec 4)))) (inc (inc (inc (inc 5)))))
(+ (dec (dec (dec 3))) (inc (inc (inc 6))))
(+ (dec (dec 2)) (inc (inc 7)))
(+ (dec 1) (inc 8))
(+ 0 9)
9
```

Both are recursive. You can tell by the fact that it calls itself and also by
the shape of the manual substitution.
