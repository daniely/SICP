First time trying this problem I got stuck. After a few days I came back to
it and decided to manually subsitute the fibonacci sequence. Doing
so helped unblock me and enabled me to finish the problem.

```
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
```

```
(+ 4 5)

# dec four times to get 4 to 0
(inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
(inc (inc (+ (dec (dec 4)) 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ (dec (dec (dec 4))) 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec (dec (dec (dec 4)))) 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec (dec (dec 3))) 5))))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec (dec 2)) 5))))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1)) 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9
```

```
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

```
(+ 4 5)

# dec four times to get 4 to 0
(+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
(+ (dec (dec 4)) (inc (inc 5)))
(+ (dec (dec (dec 4))) (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(+ (dec (dec (dec (dec 4)))) (inc (inc (inc (inc 5)))))
(+ (dec (dec (dec 3))) (inc (inc (inc 6))))
(+ (dec (dec 2)) (inc (inc 7)))
(+ (dec 1) (inc 8))
(+ 0 9)
9
```

Both are recursive. You can tell by the fact that it calls itself and also by
the shape of the manual substitution.
